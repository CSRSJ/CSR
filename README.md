# **CSR Talent Development Repo**

This repository is part of an initiative to bridge the gap between academia and industry by helping motivated students track their daily progress and align their academic learning with real-world applications. The purpose of this repository is to nurture talent by encouraging students to work consistently and develop skills relevant to the evolving market.

## **Objective**

The primary goal is to offer students a platform to demonstrate their commitment and work ethic by pushing daily commits that reflect their learning, coding practices, and project progress. By doing so, we can assess their growth, provide meaningful feedback, and align them with the best opportunities available in the industry.

## **How it Works**
- **Fork the Repository**: Each student will fork this repository to their GitHub account.
- **Daily Commits**: Students are expected to push at least one meaningful commit daily. This can include progress on learning new concepts, solving problems, or contributing to projects.
- **Progress Monitoring**: Faculty and mentors will monitor each student’s repository to track their consistency, skills development, and problem-solving approaches.
- **Feedback and Guidance**: Regular feedback will be provided based on the student’s work, with suggestions for improvement and guidance on how to apply their skills in practical settings.
- **Opportunities**: Students who show consistent effort and improvement will be aligned with career opportunities or internships based on their demonstrated skills.
